# Multi-Asset Derivatives ETF Strategy Design

## Introduction and Strategy Overview

**Objective:** Design a publicly traded ETF that uses **direct derivatives (futures)** on equities, bonds, and commodities to deliver a **leveraged multi-asset strategy**. The approach combines **trend-following momentum** and **carry** signals, augmented by a **machine-learning (ML) regime filter**, all within a robust risk management and regulatory compliance framework. By using futures (instead of an ETF-of-leveraged-ETFs structure), the strategy gains capital efficiency, liquidity, and precise control of leverage and risk exposures ([Return Stacked](https://www.returnstacked.com/carry-the-yield-ride-the-trend-a-strategic-partnership/#:~:text=Both%20trend%20and%20carry%20strategies)). The ETF will be actively managed but systematic, aiming for **transparent, rules-based execution** – essential for scaling and mitigating behavioral biases ([Return Stacked](https://www.returnstacked.com/carry-the-yield-ride-the-trend-a-strategic-partnership/#:~:text=Systematic%20approaches%20remove%20much%20of)).

**Key components:**

* **Trend-Following Signals:** Capture 12-month price momentum (time-series trend) across global equity index futures, Treasury/bond futures, and commodity futures.
* **Carry Signals:** Harvest roll yield/term-structure premia in each asset (e.g., futures basis, yield differentials) ([Carry survey PDF](https://spinup-000d1a-wp-offload-media.s3.amazonaws.com/faculty/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carry.pdf#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20the%20carry%20for)).
* **ML Regime Filter:** Supervised model distinguishes **risk-on** vs **risk-off** environments and adjusts exposure accordingly.
* **Risk Management:** Target \~10% annualized volatility with daily scaling; **drawdown-based exposure governor** to cut gross in stress.
* **Trade Implementation:** Position sizing, turnover control, and cost management (slippage, spreads, rolls).
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Designed for Investment Company Act of 1940; **Rule 18f-4** derivatives program, VaR limits, liquidity program, daily holdings transparency; **Cayman subsidiary** for commodities (RIC compliance).

## Trend-Following Signal Construction

**Signal definition:** Classic **time-series momentum** on each asset’s price (inspired by managed-futures research). Primary indicator: **12-month momentum** (total return over the past 12 months, skipping the most recent month). Positive → **long**; negative → **short** ([AQR primer](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Alternative-Thinking/Understanding-Managed-Futures-82422.pdf)). Empirically, medium-term momentum persists across assets ([Quantpedia overview](https://quantpedia.com/strategies/momentum-effect-in-commodities)).

* **Cadence:** Compute monthly; daily guardrail to catch large reversals.
* **Multi-horizon option:** Blend 3m/6m/12m (12m heaviest) to reduce whipsaws.
* **Shorting symmetry:** Futures allow symmetric long/short positioning (true time-series momentum).

**By asset class:**

* *Equity index futures:* Trend flips reduce participation in protracted bear markets and capture bull legs (crisis-alpha behavior in bear regimes) ([AQR](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Alternative-Thinking/Understanding-Managed-Futures-82422.pdf)).
* *Rates futures:* Trend adapts duration exposure (long when yields fall, short when they rise).
* *Commodity futures:* Trade each market’s own trend; useful diversification in inflationary/supply-shock regimes ([AQR](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Alternative-Thinking/Understanding-Managed-Futures-82422.pdf)).

**Position sizing:** **Volatility-scaled** so each position contributes similar ex-ante risk; inverse-vol weights lower risk concentration and auto-downshift in spikes ([AQR “Demystifying Managed Futures”](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Journal-Article/Demystifying-Managed-Futures.pdf)).

---

## Carry Signal Construction

**Carry = expected return if price is unchanged** (yield/financing/roll). Strategy: **long high-carry, short low-carry**. Carry has documented efficacy across assets (typical Sharpe \~0.8 in isolation, higher when diversified) ([Carry survey PDF](https://spinup-000d1a-wp-offload-media.s3.amazonaws.com/faculty/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carry.pdf)).

* **Equities:** Approximate carry via **dividend yield – financing rate** or futures basis. Secondary to momentum.
* **Bonds:** **Yield + roll-down** along the curve; favor higher implied carry/DV01-efficient exposures.
* **Commodities:** **Roll yield** from term structure; **backwardation = positive carry** (tilt long), **contango = negative** (tilt short). Momentum and carry often complement here ([Quantpedia](https://quantpedia.com/strategies/momentum-effect-in-commodities)).
* **FX (optional):** Interest-rate differential.

**Implementation:** Standardize carry to z-scores per asset class; rank & allocate to top/bottom cohorts; vol-scale; low turnover.

---

## Portfolio Construction & Signal Integration

**Two-sleeve architecture:** Manage **Trend** and **Carry** sleeves separately to defined **risk budgets** (e.g., 50/50 risk), then **overlay**.

* If signals **agree** on an asset (long/long or short/short), conviction ↑.
* If **conflict**, net down or weight by confidence.
* Equal-risk allocation across asset classes to avoid dominance; broad diversification boosts the **diversification ratio** and smooths returns ([Return Stacked](https://www.returnstacked.com/carry-the-yield-ride-the-trend-a-strategic-partnership/#:~:text=Diversification%20Ratio%20%3D%20Weighted%20Average)).

*Reference for equal-risk sleeves in managed-futures indices:* KMLM’s index weights markets by equal risk within sleeves ([Kraneshares KMLM](https://kraneshares.com/kmlm/#:~:text=KMLM%20is%20benchmarked%20to%20the)).

---

## Machine-Learning Regime Filter

**Goal:** Classify **risk-on vs risk-off** regimes and **scale exposure** accordingly.

* **Labels:** Risk-off when representative portfolios (e.g., 60/40 or equity factor) enter top-tail drawdowns or when vol/credit stress regimes emerge.
* **Features:** Realized vol & jumps, VIX term structure, credit & term spreads, breadth, macro nowcasts.
* **Model:** Calibrated gradient-boosted trees / logistic; output **p(risk-off)**.
* **Policy:** `exposure_scale = 1 − γ · p_off` (piecewise-linear, capped), plus minor tilts (e.g., emphasize bonds in risk-off).

Research shows crash-probability ML can improve tactical allocations over simple rules/HMMs (e.g., regime prediction for factor drawdowns) ([SSRN example](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4689090)).

---

## Risk Management Framework

**1) Volatility targeting:** Target **\~10% annualized** (≈0.63% daily). Daily estimator drives a global scale factor on positions; stabilizes risk across regimes ([AQR](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Journal-Article/Demystifying-Managed-Futures.pdf)).

**2) Drawdown governor:** Map trailing drawdown → **gross exposure scaler** (e.g., −20% gross by −5% DD; −40% by −10%; etc.). Acts as a portfolio-level circuit breaker; gradually restores as equity recovers (general discussion: drawdown control primers such as [Surmount blog](https://surmount.ai/blogs/understanding-drawdown-control-in-automated-trading-strategies)).

**3) Position limits & diversification:** Caps on per-market risk, sector/asset-class risk, and net beta. Aim for high diversification ratio ([Return Stacked](https://www.returnstacked.com/carry-the-yield-ride-the-trend-a-strategic-partnership/#:~:text=Diversification%20Ratio%20%3D%20Weighted%20Average)).

**4) Monitoring & stops:** Daily VaR/ES, stress tests (’08, ’11, ’20, ’22), breach protocols; hard daily loss alert (e.g., −4%).

**5) Leverage & margin:** With 10% vol target and diversified futures, gross notional typically **\~200–400% of NAV** while posted margin remains a fraction; excess cash in T-bills ([AQR](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/Journal-Article/Demystifying-Managed-Futures.pdf)). Manage to SEC **18f-4** VaR limits (see below).

**6) Roll & liquidity:** Staggered rolls (TWAP over window), calendar-spread awareness; only **high-liquidity** contracts.

**7) Transaction costs:** Slow signals (12m momentum, slow carry), **banding & cooldowns**, optimized execution (TWAP/VWAP/POV). Sophisticated managers can keep costs ≲1%/yr; poor execution can be 3–4%/yr (see AQR cost discussions in the references above).

---

## Trade Implementation & Operations

* **Derivatives & margin:** Accounts with FCMs; initial + variation margin; cash collateral in **T-bills** or government MMFs (common practice in managed-futures ETFs like DBMF per prospectus).
* **Execution:** Daily/weekly rebalances as needed; limit/participation algos; low participation rates; netting across sleeves.
* **Turnover & slippage:** Expect moderate turnover (monthly cadence + event-driven flips). Budget slippage via spread/vol/participation models.
* **Rolling:** Start well before expiry; 5-day TWAP typical; integrate carry view (sometimes hold further-out contracts).
* **Operations:** Independent admin, daily NAV with futures P\&L, custodial collateral, prime/FCM risk reporting.
* **Creations/redemptions:** Cash for derivative exposure portion; in-kind for collateral where practical. Maintain near-model weights post-flows.

---

## Regulatory & Compliance (ETF under 1940 Act)

**Rule 18f-4 (Derivatives):** Not a “limited derivatives user” (<10% exposure), so operate a full **Derivatives Risk Management Program** with appointed **Derivatives Risk Manager**, **daily VaR** (absolute ≤ 20% NAV at 99%/20-day or relative VaR ≤ 200% of reference), stress/backtests, board reporting ([Ropes & Gray summary](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/alerts/2020/11/sec-adopts-rule-18f-4-concerning-registered-funds-use-of-derivatives)).

**Liquidity rule (22e-4):** Futures and T-bills treated as **highly liquid**; keep ≥85% highly liquid bucket. No illiquid holdings ([Dechert explainer](https://www.dechert.com/content/dam/dechert%20files/knowledge/publication/2019/6/Drowning-in-Liquidity-the-SECs-New-Liquidity.pdf)).

**Transparency:** Active ETF with **daily holdings disclosure**. Front-running risk mitigated by liquidity, breadth, and incremental trading. Semi-transparent models (e.g., ActiveShares) are optional but likely unnecessary ([Nasdaq overview](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/active-passive-and-in-between-examining-the-etf-landscape)).

**Tax structure for commodities:** Use a **Cayman subsidiary** (≤20% of assets) to hold commodity futures so the U.S. fund maintains RIC status (see managed-futures ETF prospectuses such as DBMF on **sec.gov**).

**Board oversight & filings:** Derivatives reports to board; N-PORT/N-CEN include derivatives exposures and VaR; comply with Rule 6c-11 (ETF rule).

---

## Implementation Feasibility & Conclusion

* **Viability:** Operationally feasible with precedents (managed-futures ETFs). Liquidity depth supports scaling; ETF wrapper provides daily liquidity.
* **Modularity:** Clear sleeves (trend/carry), ML overlay, and risk layers aid explainability, compliance, and evolution.
* **Expected profile:** Historically, diversified trend and carry exhibit **positive returns, low correlation to stocks/bonds, and crisis-alpha characteristics** (stronger in major equity sell-offs). Targeting \~10% vol with drawdown/risk governors aims to cap worst-case losses while participating in long-run premia.
* **Bottom line:** A transparent, derivatives-based ETF delivering diversified **trend + carry** with **risk-aware leverage** and modern compliance is implementable and commercially defensible.

## Multi-Asset Derivatives ETF — Build Sheet (Algorithms & Programs)
Date: 2025-08-22
Owner: David

### Goal
Ship a direct-derivatives, multi-asset, trend+carry ETF with an ML regime filter, strict risk/18f-4 compliance, and robust execution.

### 1) Market Data & Instruments

#### Programs
- Instrument master & contract resolver
  * Map indices to futures symbols (e.g., ES), multipliers, ticks, sessions, contract calendars.
  * Determine front contract by liquidity; support continuous series (back- and ratio-adjusted).
- Data ingestion & QA
  * Daily OHLCV for futures chains; yield curves; dividends/financing rates; FX short rates; commodity term structures.
  * QA: missing data detection, outlier clipping, holiday calendars, contract audits.
- Continuous futures builder
  * Roll rules: volume-/OI-based or fixed (e.g., 5D before FND/LTD).
  * Adjustments: back-adjusted log or ratio-adjusted; emit both.

#### Algorithms
- Roll selection: choose next contract when OI_next > OI_curr * θ OR days-to-expiry < k.
- Back-adjustment: additive log-gap at roll; ratio for level-sensitive indicators.

### 2) Signal Engines (Alpha)

#### A) Trend (Time-Series Momentum)
- Algorithm
  * Multi-horizon momentum with skip-month: M = w3*r_3m + w6*r_6m + w12*r_12m (skip last 1M).
  * Vol standardization: signal = sign(M) * min(|M| / σ_lookback, cap).
  * Monthly recompute + daily flip check.
- Program
  * Trend engine with parameter registry, walk-forward config, feature export.

#### B) Carry
- Algorithm by asset
  * Equities: carry ≈ dividend_yield − financing_rate (or futures basis annualized).
  * Bonds: carry = yield + roll-down (DV01-aware).
  * Commodities: carry = − annualized term-structure slope (positive in backwardation).
  * FX (optional): carry = i_domestic − i_foreign.
  * Rank within buckets; long top decile, short bottom; z-score and cap.
- Program
  * Carry engine with curve readers (UST, commodity calendars), basis calculators, DV01/roll-down library.

#### C) ML Regime Filter (Risk-On/Off)
- Algorithm
  * Labels: risk-off when rolling 60/40/equity-factor DD in top tail or realized vol/credit spreads breach thresholds.
  * Features: realized vol/jumps, term/credit spreads, VIX term structure, breadth, macro nowcasts.
  * Model: gradient-boosted trees / logistic; calibrated probability p_off.
  * Output: exposure_scale = 1 − γ * p_off (piecewise to avoid overreaction).
- Program
  * Regime trainer (backtests, k-fold CV, calibration), inference service, SHAP/feature-importance reporter.

### 3) Risk Model & Constraints

#### Programs
- Covariance & vol engine
  * EWMA and Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage; block-diagonal fallback by asset class.
  * Portfolio vol forecast; diversification ratio; risk contributions.
- VaR engine (Rule 18f-4)
  * Absolute VaR (99%, 20-day) and Relative VaR vs reference; historical + parametric; remediation when breached.
- Drawdown governor
  * Track rolling max; map drawdown to gross-exposure scaler (monotone).

#### Algorithms
- Vol targeting: scale positions by k = target_vol / max(e_running_vol, ε).
- ERC (equal risk contribution): solve weights so each asset/bucket contributes equal marginal risk.
- Turnover/cost penalty: objective max wᵀμ − λ wᵀΣw − κ‖w − w_prev‖₁.

### 4) Portfolio Construction & Optimizer

#### Programs
- Sleeve builder: build Trend and Carry sleeves to their risk budgets.
- Overlay combiner: combine sleeves (e.g., 50/50 risk) → preliminary w*.
- Constrained optimizer: box caps, VaR ceiling, gross/net limits, turnover penalty, banding/cooldowns.

#### Algorithms (pseudo)
  w0 = argmax_w (w @ μ) − λ(w @ Σ @ w) − κ·L1(w − w_prev)
       s.t. sum(|w|) ≤ G_max; VaR_99_20d(w) ≤ VaR_limit; |w_i| ≤ cap_i;
            sector caps; net beta bounds
  w  = project_to_bands(w, w_prev, band=δ)
  w  = risk_scale(w, target_vol)           # vol targeting
  w  = dd_scale(w, drawdown)               # drawdown governor
  w  = w * regime_scale(p_off)             # ML exposure scale

### 5) Futures Translation, Roll & Execution

#### Programs
- Target-to-contracts: convert weights to notional by bucket; contracts via multipliers, prices, FX; DV01 normalization for rates.
- Roll manager: rolling schedule (TWAP across N days), calendar-spread pricing, slippage tracker.
- Execution engine: slicing (TWAP/VWAP/POV), session awareness, limit logic, kill-switches.
- Slippage model: spread/vol/participation-based; stress overlays.

#### Algorithms
- Contract sizing:
    contracts = (w_i * NAV * leverage_target) / (mult_i * price_i)
    (use DV01 normalization for rates futures)
- Roll TWAP: split quantity across roll window; throttle by liquidity.

### 6) Collateral & Cash/Margin

#### Programs
- Collateral allocator: T-bill ladder; haircut-aware; maintain buffer over margin.
- Margin stressor: intraday P&L shocks → variation margin → cash sufficiency alert.
- Treasury sweep: auto-balance bills vs cash.

### 7) Backtesting, Research & Validation

#### Programs
- Event-driven backtester: contract-level, realistic rolls/costs, session limits; walk-forward hyperparam tuning.
- Ablation harness: Trend-only, Carry-only, Trend+Carry, +Regime, +DD governor; report deltas.
- Compliance backtest: daily VaR, liquidity flags, banding/turnover checks; archive breaches & remediation.
- Scenario & stress: 2008, 2011, 2020, 2022; bespoke shocks; expected shortfall.

#### Algorithms
- Walk-forward: train [t−N, t), test [t, t+M); roll; lock params (no look-ahead).
- Cost model: spread + (α·volatility·sqrt(participation)) + exchange/FCM fees.

### 8) Monitoring, Operations & ETF Plumbing

#### Programs
- Live risk dashboard: vol, VaR, DD, sleeve risk, diversification ratio, risk contributions, exposure heatmaps, flows.
- Limit monitors & alerts: VaR breach, exposure caps, turnover spikes, slippage outliers, margin buffer.
- Holdings & disclosure generator: daily positions (securities + futures) PDF/CSV; website feed; commentary.
- 18f-4 compliance pack: daily VaR, stress, derivative exposure files, board dashboards.
- Cayman sub controller (commodities): position mirroring, cash/margin, audit trail, 25%/RIC tests.
- AP flows handler: creations/redemptions orchestration, cash/in-kind collateral, hedging flows.

### 9) Data Schemas (Minimum Viable)

Instruments
- symbol, asset_class, exchange, currency, point_value, tick_size, session, margin_init, margin_maint
