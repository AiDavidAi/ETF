Goal
-----
Ship a direct-derivatives, multi-asset, trend+carry ETF with an ML regime filter, strict risk/18f-4 compliance, and robust execution.

======================================================================
1) Market Data & Instruments
======================================================================

Programs
- Instrument master & contract resolver
  * Map indices to futures symbols (e.g., ES), multipliers, ticks, sessions, contract calendars.
  * Determine front contract by liquidity; support continuous series (back- and ratio-adjusted).
- Data ingestion & QA
  * Daily OHLCV for futures chains; yield curves; dividends/financing rates; FX short rates; commodity term structures.
  * QA: missing data detection, outlier clipping, holiday calendars, contract audits.
- Continuous futures builder
  * Roll rules: volume-/OI-based or fixed (e.g., 5D before FND/LTD).
  * Adjustments: back-adjusted log or ratio-adjusted; emit both.

Algorithms
- Roll selection: choose next contract when OI_next > OI_curr * θ OR days-to-expiry < k.
- Back-adjustment: additive log-gap at roll; ratio for level-sensitive indicators.

======================================================================
2) Signal Engines (Alpha)
======================================================================

A) Trend (Time-Series Momentum)
- Algorithm
  * Multi-horizon momentum with skip-month: M = w3*r_3m + w6*r_6m + w12*r_12m (skip last 1M).
  * Vol standardization: signal = sign(M) * min(|M| / σ_lookback, cap).
  * Monthly recompute + daily flip check.
- Program
  * Trend engine with parameter registry, walk-forward config, feature export.

B) Carry
- Algorithm by asset
  * Equities: carry ≈ dividend_yield − financing_rate (or futures basis annualized).
  * Bonds: carry = yield + roll-down (DV01-aware).
  * Commodities: carry = − annualized term-structure slope (positive in backwardation).
  * FX (optional): carry = i_domestic − i_foreign.
  * Rank within buckets; long top decile, short bottom; z-score and cap.
- Program
  * Carry engine with curve readers (UST, commodity calendars), basis calculators, DV01/roll-down library.

C) ML Regime Filter (Risk-On/Off)
- Algorithm
  * Labels: risk-off when rolling 60/40/equity-factor DD in top tail or realized vol/credit spreads breach thresholds.
  * Features: realized vol/jumps, term/credit spreads, VIX term structure, breadth, macro nowcasts.
  * Model: gradient-boosted trees / logistic; calibrated probability p_off.
  * Output: exposure_scale = 1 − γ * p_off (piecewise to avoid overreaction).
- Program
  * Regime trainer (backtests, k-fold CV, calibration), inference service, SHAP/feature-importance reporter.

======================================================================
3) Risk Model & Constraints
======================================================================

Programs
- Covariance & vol engine
  * EWMA and Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage; block-diagonal fallback by asset class.
  * Portfolio vol forecast; diversification ratio; risk contributions.
- VaR engine (Rule 18f-4)
  * Absolute VaR (99%, 20-day) and Relative VaR vs reference; historical + parametric; remediation when breached.
- Drawdown governor
  * Track rolling max; map drawdown to gross-exposure scaler (monotone).

Algorithms
- Vol targeting: scale positions by k = target_vol / max(e_running_vol, ε).
- ERC (equal risk contribution): solve weights so each asset/bucket contributes equal marginal risk.
- Turnover/cost penalty: objective max wᵀμ − λ wᵀΣw − κ‖w − w_prev‖₁.

======================================================================
4) Portfolio Construction & Optimizer
======================================================================

Programs
- Sleeve builder: build Trend and Carry sleeves to their risk budgets.
- Overlay combiner: combine sleeves (e.g., 50/50 risk) → preliminary w*.
- Constrained optimizer: box caps, VaR ceiling, gross/net limits, turnover penalty, banding/cooldowns.

Algorithms (pseudo)
  w0 = argmax_w (w @ μ) − λ(w @ Σ @ w) − κ·L1(w − w_prev)
       s.t. sum(|w|) ≤ G_max; VaR_99_20d(w) ≤ VaR_limit; |w_i| ≤ cap_i;
            sector caps; net beta bounds
  w  = project_to_bands(w, w_prev, band=δ)
  w  = risk_scale(w, target_vol)           # vol targeting
  w  = dd_scale(w, drawdown)               # drawdown governor
  w  = w * regime_scale(p_off)             # ML exposure scale

======================================================================
5) Futures Translation, Roll & Execution
======================================================================

Programs
- Target-to-contracts: convert weights to notional by bucket; contracts via multipliers, prices, FX; DV01 normalization for rates.
- Roll manager: rolling schedule (TWAP across N days), calendar-spread pricing, slippage tracker.
- Execution engine: slicing (TWAP/VWAP/POV), session awareness, limit logic, kill-switches.
- Slippage model: spread/vol/participation-based; stress overlays.

Algorithms
- Contract sizing:
    contracts = (w_i * NAV * leverage_target) / (mult_i * price_i)
    (use DV01 normalization for rates futures)
- Roll TWAP: split quantity across roll window; throttle by liquidity.

======================================================================
6) Collateral & Cash/Margin
======================================================================

Programs
- Collateral allocator: T-bill ladder; haircut-aware; maintain buffer over margin.
- Margin stressor: intraday P&L shocks → variation margin → cash sufficiency alert.
- Treasury sweep: auto-balance bills vs cash.

======================================================================
7) Backtesting, Research & Validation
======================================================================

Programs
- Event-driven backtester: contract-level, realistic rolls/costs, session limits; walk-forward hyperparam tuning.
- Ablation harness: Trend-only, Carry-only, Trend+Carry, +Regime, +DD governor; report deltas.
- Compliance backtest: daily VaR, liquidity flags, banding/turnover checks; archive breaches & remediation.
- Scenario & stress: 2008, 2011, 2020, 2022; bespoke shocks; expected shortfall.

Algorithms
- Walk-forward: train [t−N, t), test [t, t+M); roll; lock params (no look-ahead).
- Cost model: spread + (α·volatility·sqrt(participation)) + exchange/FCM fees.

======================================================================
8) Monitoring, Operations & ETF Plumbing
======================================================================

Programs
- Live risk dashboard: vol, VaR, DD, sleeve risk, diversification ratio, risk contributions, exposure heatmaps, flows.
- Limit monitors & alerts: VaR breach, exposure caps, turnover spikes, slippage outliers, margin buffer.
- Holdings & disclosure generator: daily positions (securities + futures) PDF/CSV; website feed; commentary.
- 18f-4 compliance pack: daily VaR, stress, derivative exposure files, board dashboards.
- Cayman sub controller (commodities): position mirroring, cash/margin, audit trail, 25%/RIC tests.
- AP flows handler: creations/redemptions orchestration, cash/in-kind collateral, hedging flows.

======================================================================
9) Data Schemas (Minimum Viable)
